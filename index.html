    <p>A tale of two sites. One version is inaccessible and one that has been remediated.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="before_u.html">Before you (with accessibility problems)</li>
      <li><a href="after_u.html">After you (fixed)</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Accessible University (AU) is a fictional university home page designed to demonstrate a variety of common web
      design problems that result in visitors with disabilities being unable to access content or features. AU was
      originally developed by <a href="http://www.washington.edu/accessit">AccessIT</a> and is maintained by
      <a href="http://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing">AccessComputing</a>, both projects based out of
      the University of Washington. </p>
    <p>This version of the Accessible University site, by Duke University, includes updates to the look, feel, and code.
      It has been adapted to use the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/">Twitter
        Bootstrap</a> framework since many components in the Bootstrap framework provide a quality accessible base to
      work from.</p>
    <p>Use the AU site to:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Demonstrate common web accessibility principles at trainings, presentations, and workshops on accessible web
        design.</li>
      <li>Learn common web accessibility problems and solutions in an easy-to-understand way.</li>
    </ol>
